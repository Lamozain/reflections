1. Now I can compare text files using windows or mac. 
2. Starting the course again to learn how to push commits 
and possibly access them.
3. Having access to version control could reduce my worries
and make sure I can go back to some earlier codes.
4. git diff oldcommitSHA newcommitSHA is useful for comparison.
5. Each commit should reflect a logical change.
6. Include README.txt file of your project in your repo describing
your project to those that may work on it. 
7. git log is useful to view commit history. It takes flags.
8. git checkout SHA ca be used to locate bugs in the programme
through sequential checking or keeping aside of commits and playing 
or running the programme.
9. I will like to use git for sharing my work with developers and
 to house my portfolio.
